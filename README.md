This is "sustainaBite", an app created by 4 people at Kode With Klossy Seattle 2023. 
We are incredibly passionate about the environment and organic foods, as the current agricultural sector produces up to 40% of global CO2 emissions. 
At SustainaBite, our mission is to empower individuals with dietary restrictions by providing sustainable and organic recipes. We believe that everyone 
deserves to enjoy delicious meals that align with their dietary needs while having a positive impact on the environment.
Our app includes an Apple Map API, a search feature, and a filtering option for recipes.
